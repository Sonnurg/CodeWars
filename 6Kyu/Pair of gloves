//Winter is coming, you must prepare your ski holidays. The objective of this kata is to determine the number of pair of gloves you can constitute from the 
//gloves you have in your drawer.
//Given an array describing the color of each glove, return the number of pairs you can constitute, assuming that only gloves of the same color can form pairs.

//my solution 
function numberOfPairs(gloves)

const counts = {};

for (const num of gloves) {
  counts[num] = counts[num] ? counts[num] + 1 : 1;
}
  Object.keys(counts).forEach(key => {
  if (counts[key]<2) delete counts[key];
});
  let pairs = 0;
 for ( color in counts) {
 pairs+=Math.floor(counts[color] / 2)
}
  return pairs
