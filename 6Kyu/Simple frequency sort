//DESCRIPTION:
//In this Kata, you will sort elements in an array by decreasing frequency of elements. If two elements have the same frequency, sort them by increasing value.
// My Solution

function solve(arr){
  let res={}
 arr.forEach(i=>res[i]=res[i]+1||+1)
 return arr.sort((a,b)=>res[b]-res[a] || a-b)
}
