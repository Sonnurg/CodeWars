//A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.

//Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed
//The total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8.

//my solution
function dataReverse(data) {
let arr=[]
for(let i=0;i<data.length;i+=8){
  arr.push(data.slice(i,i+8))
}
  return arr.reverse().flat()
}
