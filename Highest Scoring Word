//Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

//Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

//You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

//If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

//All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

//My solution

function high(x){
let word= x.split(' ')
const score=(w)=> w.split('').reduce((pre,cur)=>pre+cur.charCodeAt(0)-96,0)
let scoreArr= word.map(x=>score(x))
let highestS=0
let highestI=0
scoreArr.forEach((sco,i)=>{
  if(sco>highestS){
    highestI=i
    highestS=sco
  }
})
  return word[highestI]
}
