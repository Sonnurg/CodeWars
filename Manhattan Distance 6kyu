//DESCRIPTION:
//The distance formula can be used to find the distance between two points. What if we were trying to walk from point A to point B, but there were buildings in 
//the way? We would need some other formula..but which?

//Manhattan Distance
//Manhattan distance is the distance between two points in a grid (like the grid-like street geography of the New York borough of Manhattan) calculated by only 
//taking a vertical and/or horizontal path.

//Complete the function that accepts two points and returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.

//The points are arrays or tuples containing the x and y coordinate in the grid. You can think of x as the row in the grid, and y as the column.

//my solution
function manhattanDistance(pA, pB){
  let dis=0
  for(let i=0;i<pA.length;i++){
   dis+= Math.abs(pA[i] - pB[i])
  }
  return dis
}


//solution 2
function manhattanDistance(pA, pB){
  return Math.abs(pA[0]-pB[0])+Math.abs(pA[1]-pB[1])
}
