//DESCRIPTION:
//Steve and Josh are bored and want to play something.
//They don't want to think too much, so they come up with a really simple game. Write a function called winner and figure out who is going to win.
//They are dealt the same number of cards. They both flip the card on the top of their deck. Whoever has a
//card with higher value wins the round and gets one point (if the cards are of the same value, neither of them gets a point).
//After this, the two cards are discarded and they flip another card from the top of their deck. They do this until they have no cards left.
//deckSteve and deckJosh are arrays representing their decks. They are filled with cards, represented by a single character. 

//My solution
function winner(deckSteve, deckJosh) {
  let points={'2':2,'3':3,'4':4,'5':5,'6':6,'7':7,'8':8,'9':9,'T':10,'J':11,'Q':12,'K':13,'A':14 }
  
 let steveScore=0
 let joshScore=0
 let dS=deckSteve.map(x=>points[x])
 let dJ=deckJosh.map(x=>points[x])
 for(let i=0;i<deckSteve.length;i++){
   
   if(dS[i]>dJ[i]){
     steveScore+=1
   }else if(dS[i]<dJ[i]){
     joshScore+=1
   }
 }
  if(joshScore>steveScore){
    return `Josh wins ${joshScore} to ${steveScore}`
  }else if(joshScore<steveScore){
     return `Steve wins ${steveScore} to ${joshScore}`
  }else{
    return "Tie"
  }
}
